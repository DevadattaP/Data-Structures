# Data Structures Programs (Semester 3 - Computer Science Engineering, AI & ML)

This repository contains various practical programs implemented as part of the Data Structures course (Semester 3) in the Computer Science Engineering (AI & ML) curriculum at the University of Mumbai. The programs are written in C and executed using the Turbo C++ software, utilizing the graphics library.

## Introduction

This repository includes a collection of data structures programs designed to demonstrate key concepts such as stack operations, queue operations, linked lists, and graph traversal techniques. The programs cover both basic and advanced data structures, implemented using C.

## Programs Included

The repository contains the following programs:

1. **Stack Implementation**
2. **Queue Implementation**
3. **Circular Queue Implementation**
4. **Double-Ended Queue (Deque) Implementation**
5. **Linked List Implementation**
6. **Circular Linked List Implementation**
7. **Doubly Linked List Implementation**
8. **Polynomial Representation Using Linked List**
9. **Infix to Postfix Conversion**
10. **Evaluation of Postfix Expression**
11. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm**
12. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm**

## Prerequisites

To run these programs, you'll need:

- A standard C compiler (like GCC)
- Basic understanding of C programming
- Familiarity with data structures conceptsepts

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/DevadattaP/Data-Structures.git
    cd Data-Structures
   ```

2. **Compile the Program:**
   - Use a C compiler to compile the desired .c file. For example:
    ```sh
        gcc Stack.c -o Stack
    ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the compiled program:
    ```sh
        ./stack
    ```

## Program Descriptions

### 1. Stack Implementation
    Implements a stack data structure with basic operations like push, pop, and display.

### 2. Queue Implementation
    Implements a queue data structure with basic operations like enqueue, dequeue, and display.

### 3. Circular Queue Implementation
    Implements a circular queue to efficiently utilize the queue space.

### 4. Double-Ended Queue (Deque) Implementation
    Implements a deque allowing insertion and deletion at both ends.

### 5. Linked List Implementation
    Implements a singly linked list with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### 6. Circular Linked List Implementation
    Implements a circular linked list where the last node points back to the head node.

### 7. Doubly Linked List Implementation
    Implements a doubly linked list with nodes pointing to both the next and previous nodes.

### 8. Polynomial Representation Using Linked List
    Represents and manipulates polynomials using linked lists.

### 9. Infix to Postfix Conversion
    Converts an infix expression to a postfix expression using stack operations.

### 10. Evaluation of Postfix Expression
    Evaluates a postfix expression using a stack.

### 11. Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm
    Implements BFS for graph traversal, exploring all neighbor nodes before moving on to the next level.

### 12. Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm
    Implements DFS for graph traversal, exploring as far along a branch as possible before backtracking.
